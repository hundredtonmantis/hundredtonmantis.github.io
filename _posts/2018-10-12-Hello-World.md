HELLO.

This blog is about my experience learning web development with Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy.com

I bought the course because I want a good refresher on web development before I start some projects of my own AND because it was on sale for $11.

The main content of this blog will consist of my thoughts on each section, notes on parts of the lectures I find interesting and important, and finally some links to stuff I make while taking the course.

Although I know a good amount about computers (use Linux as my main OS, comfortable with the commmand line, able to follow most technical documentation, have done some Python programming, etc.) I am going to approach everything in this course as if I was a newcomer to the subject. I believe this will be good for me in a number of ways and I will expand on why in the next post I make.


Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
