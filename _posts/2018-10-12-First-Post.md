HELLO.

This blog is about my experience learning web development with Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy.com

I bought the course because I want a good refresher on web development before I start some projects of my own AND because it was on sale for $11.

The main content of this blog will consist of my thoughts on different sections of the course as I work through them, notes on parts of the lectures I find interesting and important, and finally some links to stuff I make while taking the course.

Although I know a good amount about computers (use Linux as my main OS, comfortable with the command line, able to follow most technical documentation, have setup web and game servers, have made simple websites, have done some Python programming, etc.), I am going to approach everything in this course as if I was a newcomer to the subject. I believe this will be good for me in a number of ways and I will expand on why in the next post I make.

I will attempt to continue posting on a regular basis, at least a few times a week until I complete the course. After that I will probably host a blog elsewhere and post a link to it in my final post here.


Since this blog was started using the jekyll-now static blog setup from Barry Clarke, the first post originally contained information on how to get started using the blog. I have preserved this below for my own reference.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
