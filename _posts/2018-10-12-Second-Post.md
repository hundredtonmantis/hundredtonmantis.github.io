Some more notes on how I will approach this course.

As I stated in the First Post, I will be approaching everything taught in this "The Web Development Bootcamp" as if
I am learning it for the first time. My reason for this is to instill in myself an attitude of "Following Standards" and
also "Being Flexible". These two "virtues" of development are not often emphasized in technical tutorials and because
of this I never learned them very well.

They are both very important for two main reasons.

**When developing, you will very often have to build things for other people. Sometimes those people are crazy and irrational
but sometimes it's you that is crazy, irrational, or just plain stubborn. It can be hard to tell.
**When developing, the tools and sytems you end up using will many times not be chosen by you. You may have to use someone else's
choice of blog engine or CMS. You may not even get to choose your own text editor. It is important to be able to be productive
even when things are not exactly as you wish them to be.

Following standards also allows you to have less "choice anxiety" when making decisions because if something is unfamiliar to you,
you can just go with the "standard". You can just use what the other developers are using or whatever is already in place. No
need to port things to newer, better systems. Just use what there is and get on with it. Sometimes it isn't really that 
important. At least not nearly as important and just getting it done.

Being flexible allows you to work better with others because you can stop caring about everything being a certain ideal way. 
Instead, you can just use what is already in place and get the work done.

As nice as it is to be able to completely customize a system to fit your liking, sometimes it's a waste of time. You could be
building interestng projects for others or making money, or going for a bike ride. You have to pick your battles.

So, while I will continue to enjoy my customized i3 Window Manager setup; I am using the standard Ubuntu LTS install, I have
install Chromium, and I have installed Sublime Text for my editor. Because that is the recommended options for this course and 
I don't need to be fighting to use my entire choice of weapons right now. I need to be completing this web development course.

That's all for now but I plan to write a little more on this subject in a later post.
